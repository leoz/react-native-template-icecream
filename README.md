# React Native Template IceCream

A simple React Native template to get started with [Realm JS](https://github.com/realm/realm-js) and [IceCream](https://github.com/caiyue1993/IceCream) quickly.

## Usage

```
npx react-native init AwesomeIceCreamProject --template @leoz/react-native-template-icecream
```

## What is included

This template is based on two great components:

- [Realm JS](https://github.com/realm/realm-js), using its awesome template package [react-native-template-realm-js](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/tree/master/templates/react-native-template-realm-js) with some minor modifications
- [IceCream](https://github.com/caiyue1993/IceCream) - a library to Sync Realm Database with CloudKit, more specifically, a more [up-to-date version](https://github.com/EricWiener/IceCream) created by [Eric Wiener](https://github.com/EricWiener)
